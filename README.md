Project of two people creating both a database from scratch in PgAdmin, and created ways to use the Chinook database to get customers, delete and update them. 

You can find the SQL scripts in the SQLScripts folder. These can be used to create and modify a superhero database.

## Background

Some hotshot media mogul has heard of your newly acquired skills in Java. They have contracted you and a friend to
stride on the edge of copyright glory and start re-making iTunes, but under a different name. They have spoken to
lawyers and are certain a working prototype should not cause any problems and ensured that you will be safe. The
lawyer they use is the same that Epic has been using, so they are familiar with Apple. 

And Nick forced us to. 

## Install

This program can't really be run. Just download the files and open it in your favorite IDE and you can see that it does indeed work :)

## Usage

The SQL scripts can be run by creating a new database in PgAdmin and used the Query Tool to run the scripts. 

For the Chinook database, press the Run button in your IDE and it should run just fine.
